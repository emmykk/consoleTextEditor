# Overview: (WIP)
Proof-of-concept / prototype terminal text editor built to practice linked data structure concepts.

Will likely expand functionality in the future to support syntax highlighting and
live text editing.

Currently migrating files, but supports:

- text editing of .txt files ()
- cursor highlighting
- All commands can be entered lowercase or uppercase and are displayed in the options menu after a user command is processed.

# Startup:
The program will prompt you to enter a filename with a .txt extension.  The file must be a .txt file. If the file name you entered does not exist, the editor will create a new file in which you’ll be able to add your changes.
If the file exists, you’ll begin editing your specified file.

# Command input

All commands can be entered lowercase or uppercase and are displayed in the options menu after a user command is processed.
