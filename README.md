# Overview: (WIP)
Proof-of-concept / prototype terminal text editor.

Supports editing `.txt` files at the moment.
Can be run using `python3 editor.py`.

Will likely expand functionality in the future to support syntax highlighting and
live text editing.

## Current features (not necessarily exhaustive)
- text editing of .txt files ()
- cursor highlighting
- copy and paste
- first, last, next, and previous line cursor functions
- insertion, removal, and replacement of lines
- GOTO line number 
- find & replace word
- hide and show file view from editor (in console)
- All commands can be entered lowercase or uppercase and are displayed in the options menu after a user command is processed.

# Startup:
The program will prompt you to enter a filename with a .txt extension.  The file must be a .txt file. If the file name you entered does not exist, the editor will create a new file in which you’ll be able to add your changes.
If the file exists, you’ll begin editing your specified file.

# Command input

All commands can be entered lowercase or uppercase and are displayed in the options menu after a user command is processed.
